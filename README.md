# RewindGS

Shitty attempt for making an open source fortnite gameserver. Not sure how far I'll get with this because I have no experience at all with this type of stuff and have no real idea on what to do

A lot of this code (specifically pattern scanning and function hooking) comes from Guided Hacking youtube tutorials , you can find them by searching up on Youtube or on Google "Guided Hacking" 

If I , for whatever reason , use anyone else's code in this as well I will be sure to credit them here as well as near the part where I use their code in the source code.

## How to build?

Not explaining rn. Figure it out yourself until I make a proper tutorial.

## How to inject?

- Use [UE4Injector](https://github.com/Zebratic/UE4Injector) 10/10 injector.
